# Logistic Regression for Breast Cancer Detection

## 📌 Objective
Use Logistic Regression to predict whether a breast tumor is **benign or malignant**
based on medical features.

---

## 📂 Dataset
Breast Cancer dataset containing features such as:
- Clump Thickness
- Uniformity of Cell Size
- Uniformity of Cell Shape
- Marginal Adhesion
- Bare Nuclei
- Mitoses
- etc.

**Target column:**
- `Class`
  - 2 → Benign
  - 4 → Malignant

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn

---

## ⚙️ Steps Performed
1. Load dataset
2. Drop non-informative column (Sample code number)
3. Handle missing values
4. Separate features and target
5. Split data into training and testing sets (70/30)
6. Train Logistic Regression model
7. Evaluate model using:
   - Accuracy
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Classification Report

---

## 📊 Model Evaluation
- Accuracy score
- Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Confusion Matrix

---

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Upload dataset to Google Colab
2. Run notebook cells step by step
3. View model performance metrics

---

## ✅ Conclusion
Logistic Regression effectively classifies breast cancer tumors
into benign or malignant using medical attributes.
